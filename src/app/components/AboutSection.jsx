                    Since graduating from college with a B.S. in biotechnology, I have worked as a QA engineer while also gaining experience in the pharmaceutical industry as a chemist. My background in both fields has strengthened my analytical skills, attention to detail, and problem-solving abilities. About two years ago, I joined GTDM as a QA engineer, and I‚Äôve never been happier! I take pride in designing and implementing efficient testing processes, ensuring software quality, and driving automation efforts. I am always looking to learn and improve my skills, and I am currently focusing on low-level languages like Go and C to enhance my approach to testing and automation.

                    In my free time, I enjoy going to the gym (I NEVER skip legs üò§), watching sports with friends, and playing
                    digital card games. Feel free to hit me up if you want to theorycraft some spice for Yu-Gi-Oh!, Pokemon, Hearthstone,
                    or Marvel Snap ‚òùÔ∏èü§ì.
