                    Since graduating from college with a B.S. in biotechnology, I have worked in many different industries.
                    I was on the QA engineering end of things for a bit before working as a chemist in the
                    pharmaceutical industry. However, about 2 years ago, I became a full-stack software developer at GTDM and
                    I've never been happier! I am a self-taught developer who prides himself on the ability to adapt to any
                    environment and find creative solutions to difficult problems. As a software developer, I have been able to
                    scratch that problem-solving itch every single day. I am always looking to learn and improve my skills. Currently
                    I am focusing on learning and working with low level languages like Go and C.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    In my free time, I enjoy going to the gym (I NEVER skip legs üò§), watching sports with friends, and playing
                    digital card games. Feel free to hit me up if you want to theorycraft some spice for Yu-Gi-Oh!, Pokemon, Hearthstone,
                    or Marvel Snap ‚òùÔ∏èü§ì.
