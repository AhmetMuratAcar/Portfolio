# Welcome
This is all of the code for my portfolio website hosted at [murat.software](https://www.murat.software/).

If you want to mess around with the code for your own portfolio you can do so by cloning this repo and doing the following:

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).


First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

At this point everything but the contact form will be 100% functional. If you want to build and test the contact form check out the [Resend](https://resend.com/docs/introduction) documentation. Super easy and straightforward if you have your own domain.

# Techstack
This website is built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), Javascript and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). It is hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/). The backend of the contact form is done through [Resend](https://resend.com/).
